\section{Analysis}
In this part we calculate complexity of the code
that was written in the previous section. In this 
Analysis we only consider the code related to solving
the sudoku and we ignore the reading from the file 
and storing them in matrix. Suppose our puzzle is $N*N$ and
it has $K$ elements to fill. First thing that we will
calculate is emptycells, that it takes $O(N*N)$ cause
we need to visit all the cell to see which one has the value
of zero. The next part is sudoku function that in the 
worst case it will run on the all choices so our runtime is
the recursive form of the following:
$$
T(k) = 9T(k-1) + max(O(N),O(k))
$$
By a little bit of sloppiness about k the number of
empty cells and by considering that k is a number betwenn $1\leq K \leq N*N$
the above recurrence give us the time complexity of
$O(9^{N*N})$.
For the space complexity we will need O(N*N) to just store
the puzzle and other varibales don't exceed this bound.
